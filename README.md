# ClientTracker
Client Tracker app for personal use.

After learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a few weeks, I decided to make an app to keep track of my clients as a freelancer.

The app is intended to take in basic information about the client and produce a "card" containing all of that information. Ultimately, these cards will all be displayed on index.html. There will be search and filter features.

The main point is to keep track of the various clients that hire me on various platforms, with particular attention paid to the last contact I had with them and when that contact happened, as a common problem (in my case) is losing track of clients due to the sheer volume.

In reality, this is really just my first web development project, my first attempt to apply the skills I have learned in the last 3 weeks. If I can get this working as intended, I should be able to confidently work as a web developer despite being rather bad at this.

That's all.
